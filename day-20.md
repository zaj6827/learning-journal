#Day-20 Entry

Today we finally presented! Everything went well, and I was proud of the product we had in the time constraint we made it. I was incredibly nervous about the public speaking aspect of this assignment, since it's been a long time since I've done any kind of public speaking. But I think I did okay, and my group mates did wonderful. This was a very rewarding experience, and it's not one I'll soon forget.
