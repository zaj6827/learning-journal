# 301 Day 10

Today I was out sick, but thankfully a lot of my classmates said they had me covered. It was actually amazing seeing the outpouring of support from so many people, it's been rough moving here and trying to adjust and make friends, but I feel a bit more comfortable now that this has happened. I know I'm gonna have to catch up. I just hope I don't fall too far behind.
