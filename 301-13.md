#301 Day 13
Today me and Maddy ran through deployment to Heroku. We ran into some difficulty with errors, until we realized that we were running off of old master code. Heroku runs off of our local system, so we had to git pull origin master to make sure it was up to date, then push to Heroku master. After that, everything ran perfect. It was a good learning experience, and not one I'll soon forget.
