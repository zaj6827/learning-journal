#301 Day 3
The difficulty is increasing drastically. I'm sure I'll feel comfortable with JQuery by sometime next week, but right now I am struggling. My portfolio was going pretty well, but I haven't decided how I want things to look, and I really shot myself in the foot by not commiting to a layout sooner. It's to the point that I might just tear down everything and rebuild it on the weekend. None of my functionality is working as intended, and I think it's because of how I structured and implemented from day 1. I really wanted to try to go to this hackathon, but I don't think I'll be able to, or else I'm gonna fall behind in class and have to play catch up even more. We'll see how things go, right now I'm barely treading water, I hope things get slightly better.
