#301 Day 5
Today was hectic, I wasn't able to watch the 401 project presentations like I wanted, but I did get to set up a time on Sunday for me and other students to come down and work together on our portfolios. I feel like with the extra work, I'll be able to catch up a bit, and be more comfortable with where I'm at in the class.
