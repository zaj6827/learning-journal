#Day-18

Started working on our new project after we decided to scrap our sliding puzzle idea. Made a lot of progress in one day. We are rendering pictures, randomizing them, and tracking score. We just need to finish styling, complete local storage, render score board, and complete our about us page, and we'll be good to go.
