#301 Day 1
Today we went over mobile first developing, and responsive web design. In hindsight, it makes absolute sense, though it would have been much more difficult to understand if it was taught in 201. It took me a little bit of research to fully understand media queries, but I feel very confident in them now. I still need to get used to using em instead of px, to make sure things scale better for different viewports, but I'm feeling like it'll be a habit that becomes easier with time. I'm looking forward to making a website that is fully functional with good designs for cellphones, tablets, and desktops. It still sounds challenging, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it when I get more comfortable with SMACCS.
