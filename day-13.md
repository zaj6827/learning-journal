#Day 13

This project really killed me, but the sense of accomplishment when me and Ian finally finished both of our projects was immense. I still feel like I only have a basic grasp on a lot of the concepts we covered in this project, like the Chart.js. I feel like if I practice with it more, or if I'm confronted with a similar problem again, I'll be able to identify my problems, and solve them much more quickly.
