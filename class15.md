#Day 15
I've learned a lot through the course of this class, I didn't realize how much until Sam went back and showed us our About Me from week 1. I'm still a little shaky on the newer things that we've learned but I'm sure I'll get it with time. My group for project week seems spirited, and I think we'll do well.
