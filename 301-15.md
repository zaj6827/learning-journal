#301 Day 15
Today Shaun and I went over a code review for lab. It was interesting to see some new methods, and learn how they work. I think the one that threw me off the most was the .match method. It takes in a RegExp as an argument, and it was humbling how simplistic it was. Regex is something I really want to work on, it seems like the better you get at it, the less code you'd have to write. I also got to go over the plan of attack with my teammates for Project Week. I'm really nervous since the project idea is mine, and I don't want to let my team down. I think we'll be alright, although I anticipate a few late nights. All in all, I'm excited.
