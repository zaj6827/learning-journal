Today I did pair programming with Maddy. It was a very accomplishing experience.
I feel like I learned a lot today on how arrays work. We did that for the stretch goal.
I also feel like I got a better understanding of if/else. I broke that for question 7.
Brandon helped me get that sorted out though. All in all, a really busy day.
