#Day-19 Entry

Today went incredibly smooth. The whole team worked together to make sure as much as possible got done today. It did get mildly frustrating at times, due to not being able to move on until another member's work was done, but even then it was just a matter of realizing that they are trying their hardest, and everyone deserves each other's patience and respect. I look forward to finishing things tomorrow and I'm very proud of my group.
