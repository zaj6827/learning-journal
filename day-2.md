# Learning Journal: Day 2

Today I learned how to make repositories
and a little bit of markdown language. Some of
the stuff I learned is how to *italicize* **bold**
and ***bold italicize.*** I'm having a bit of trouble with the pace right now, but I feel speed will come with practice and experience. So I'm gonna keep at it. Hopefully I can finish this journal entry and Lab 2 before 5, so I can catch my bus, get home, and veg out on Netflix.
